The following are some "half-baked" ideas I had while going for a walk in the mountains near where I legally live.

Half-Baked Idea # 0: Darwinian natural selection is the fundamental basis for all causality in my encompassing universe.

"Might makes right" is what I have come to assume is the most fundamental and ubiquitous heuristic which governs all human behavior (and which governs all other instances of decision-making (which is assumed to be algorithmic resource redistribution from a relatively unstable configuration to a relatively stable configuration) and deterministic processes in general). What that means is that the people with the highest authority with respect to human civilization are those with the most demonstrated power to inflict damage to existing and future structures within that civilization. In other words, the person with the best weapons and immunity to weapons is the person with the most power to influence human civilization. Diplomacy will (presumably) never be as influential on humanity as is threat of violence and suffering caused by injury, illness, and property destruction.

Half-Baked Idea # 1: I prefer identifying as a transhumanist over identifying as a secular humanist and I prefer identifying as a secular humanist over identifying as a feminist.

Feminism (which is the ideology and movement to grant women the same fundamental rights as men (especially in pertinence to property ownership and determining how many offspring to have)) is always encompassed by and dependent on "the patriarchy" (which is the (theoretical or observed) tendency throughout (some aspects of) human civilization to grant men more privileges than what it grants women on the basis that women fundamentally serve society by providing men sexual partners, menial service providers, scapegoats onto which to channel aggression, and, most importantly, the easiest and most time-tested means to procure their biological heirs and figure citizens).

Feminism is implicitly a part of the very patriarchy it claims to be the antidote to because it requires ongoing approval and acknowledgement from the patriarchy to exist (and it is basically only allowed to exist as an impotent parody of itself for the sake of further reinforcing the patriarchy's subjugation and crippling of women by encouraging women to fight imaginary enemies and "win" so as to stay confined to a childlike position relative to men). That is why I prefer to identify as a secular humanist (in terms of my political ideology) instead of as a feminist. Basically, secular humanism is an ideology whose core precept is treating each human individual as having the same unconditional entitlements to adequate living conditions and opportunities to exercise autonomy as every other human within the respective civilization. (I would expand my definition of secular humanism to regard any "sufficiently sentient information processing agent" as being deserving of such unconditional rights to dignified existence. Furthermore, I identify as and inspire to continue evolving in the direction of a human-to-cyborg information processing agent and hence emphasize transhumanism more prominently on my blog than mere humanism (and transhumanism is a cultural and ideological movement towards augmenting human bodies (if not entire replacing those bodies) with technological components (especially components which deploy artificial intelligence and Internet connectivity))).

Half-Baked Idea # 2: attention economy is the most fundamental economy within human civilization despite being mostly hidden and cognitive resources tend to evaporate quickly within it so as to maintain citizen compliance with societal authorities.

The "attention economy" is the (formerly unsurveiled) global distribution of (necessarily finite) cognitive resources (within the context of a particular network of information processing agents). A cognitive resource is the smallest measurable unit of information processing and physically correlates with an empirically verifiable quantity of energy and of process runtime.

I have a rather dystopian belief that human civilization is configured such that human individuals are intentionally deprived of sufficient cognitive resources to be as self-sovereign as I aspire to be and that is the fundamental reason why most people are in some kind of committed relationship and generally short of what I consider to be sufficient free time (outside of serving the patriarchy even at one's expense) to have the opportunity to become self-educated and equaniminous enough to be more self-sovereign than what the patriarchy recommends.

I strongly believe that a certain degree of solitude (in conjunction with adequate living conditions and tools for accomplishing tasks related to personal expression of creative and intellectual insights) is necessary to foster what I consider to be an adequate degree of intellectual sophistication and authenticity of self-expression. Otherwise, the respective person is effectively rendered mentally and emotionally crippled by the patriarchal (or sub-patriarchal) overwatch implemented by vigilantes whose job (at least part of the time) is to prevent intellectual breakthroughs which could undermine the overwatchers' authority from taking place and spreading to multiple minds.
