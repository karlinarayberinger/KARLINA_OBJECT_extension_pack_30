Today I got a pap smear done and my intrauterine device (IUD) removed. I feel quite relieved (especially due to the fact that eventually the IUD could have become embedded in the uterine lining (or what little remains of it). If that were to happen, surgery may be required to extract it and, even worse, I could suffer a potentially fatal (or relatively permanent) injury due to infection from the puncture wound and excessive bleeding (especially from surgical complications).

It should be noted that karbytes is voluntarily celibate and prefers to live as monastic lifestyle as it can afford.

Also, that IUD was installed since some time period before 01_JANUARY_2016 and 01_SEPTEMBER_2015. 

Prior to the IUD installation, I was using estrogen-progesterone daily pills before 01_JANUARY_2016 and after 01_JANUARY_2009.

Prior to the estrogen-progesterone daily pills, I was using testosterone cypianate intramuscular injections.
