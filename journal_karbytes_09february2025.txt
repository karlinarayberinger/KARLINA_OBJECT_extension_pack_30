I almost tweeted the following: "karbytes is the evil son. Karlina is the good daughter."

Another thought I had today (and have had at least once some other day this year before today) is as follows: "A person should not have to be hospitalized merely for not having the desire for an intimate partner."

karbytes: "Privacy is power (if and only if I have more of it than my competitors)."

karbytes: "There is a certain kind of 'power' in being at the lowest rank of power (and even stripped of 'privacy' (especially if the respective low ranking individual makes no distinction between private and public (or non private)))."

karbytes: "Some people seem to try to use my cognitive and economic resources for their own ends and without my consent (due to mostly uncontested power inequalities between me and those people)."

karbytes: "I am unconditionally a part of all existence."
